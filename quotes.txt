   Bring music to life.
Put your hands up in the air
Gone Chopin â€¦ Bach in five.
Got Mozart? We love Mozart
Hear it. See it. Live it.
  Let the Music Speak
Life is a song, love is the music.
  Like music to my ears.
Music is an outburst of the soul.
 Music is My Time Machine.
Music is only love looking for words.
Music is the shorthand of emotion.
Music is what feelings sound like.
Music makes the world go round.
Music only makes me stronger.
Music, the mosaic of the air.
 Music: My Anti-depressant.
Rock Off and Rave on 4-ever.
Touching heaven on frequency.
Trumpet: Classy Brassy Sassy!
Tuba: Play with the Big Boys.
When words fail, music speaks.
Where clarinets go, treble follows!
Where words fail, music speaks.
Dance to the rhythm of your heart.
